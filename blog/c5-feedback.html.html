      Pairing and Feedback are very important core values of DevBootcamp.
      This goes along with the idea that as students of DevBootcamp we are active participants in our learning and not simply consumers awaiting for the information to be imparted unto us.
      Pairing and Feedback in a way can be amalgamated as tough love in a number of ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain amount of vulnerability that comes with both pairing and giving/receiving feedback.
      With pairing, you are reliant on another person who may have more or less knowledge (or equal) than you.
      In the same manner, they are reliant on you.  
      If you are behind the other person in knowledge or ability it can make you feel quite awkward or even ashamed.
      Yet it is still in your best interest to share that vulnerability, because hiding that and just playing along cheats you out of the full experience.
      You miss out on the opportunity to learn and improve yourself.  
      Pairing gives you the opportunity to learn and grow, but it requires that you share a part of yourself that might be weak and not fully developed,
      but that shouldn't be such a detriment. 
      Everyone has weak areas, else why would we be in school to develop them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Feedback similarly operates as a double edged sword.  Good feedback has 3 attributes, it must be actionable, specific, and kind.
      It is not always easy to give feedback that hits on all 3 attributes.
      It is also not always easy to receive feedback.
      Good feedback points out our flaws and our weaknesses.
      This can be quite the blow to the ego, but without it we might not know.
      Or if we are aware of a weak area, we might be so weak as to not understand where it is that we are lacking.
      Specific and actionable feedback can lead us in the right direction.
      Kind feedback makes us more willing to go in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also helps to remember that giving feedback is not always an easy thing either.
      Though it can be beneficial to both parties.
      It not only forces you to look at the other party, but to look at the other party in relation to yourself.
      To give good feedback, you have to understand the material well enough to comment on it,
      additionally you have to understand how it is that you operate as someone to pair with.
      It forces the person giving feedback to understand how they respond to certain stimuli.
      Why it is that some behavior is preferably to other behavior.
      Everyone has a different learning style, and with feedback we can see how different learning styles fit with our own.
