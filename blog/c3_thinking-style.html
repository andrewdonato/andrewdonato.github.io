  <h1>Learning and thinking about things</h1>
  <h2>Concrete Random vs Abstract Random</h2>
  <h4>4/5/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      After taking the Gregorc Thinking Style test I have found that I am equal parts Abstract Random(AR) and Concrete Random(CR).
      While my tests came out to be even, based on my research on how each type of person operates, I found that I feel like I lean more towards the concrete random side of things.  I agreed with more of the descriptors of the concrete random learning style than I do the abstract random way.

    <p>
      Concrete random learners are more focused on learning things on their own while abstract random learners are more socially based.  I personally prefer learning things on my own, but cannot discount how helpful it is to work with other people in order to learn.  Abstract learning is very helpful to me, however the pacing is very important and often hard to get right.  It is difficult to find that middle ground where both parties benefit.  I do not like when my lack of knowledge slows the pacing of getting stuff done in a group and so often I simply just try to follow along even if I've fallen behind.  Similarly I worry about the other person following along with me if I have the faster pace.  This is also due to the random part of my learning style, because I am all over the place, it's sometimes hard to follow along with what I am thinking.
      It is for these reasons that I prefer the concrete random learning style rather than the abstract random.  While I benefit from both, one simply causes too much internal conflict in me.  Also ammusingly people with a concret random learning style don't like choosing just one answer.

       Fitting into devbootcamp has been a struggle for me.  In many ways this is related to my learning style.  As a concrete random learner I like to experiment and work with trial and error.  However, this burns up time in many ways.  Trial and error is exactly as it sounds, multiple testing, multiple errors.  While it does help me gain a full understanding of how things work, those iterations take time.  Additionally it sometimes takes me extra time to learn enough in order to perform the trials and errors since my learning style is not geared towards formal reports.

      Based on my learning style I think the best thing for me to do in order for me to succeed at DBC is to cater to both the CR and the AR.
      I should get to the point where I am knowledgable enough to trial and error, and once at that point I should attempt to pair with someone who will let me drive while being familiar enough with the material to follow along or redirect me back onto track.

      <h2>Fixed mindset vs. Dynamic mindset.</h2>
      Like learning style, I was not able to relate to just one type of mindset. Typically with fun things or kinesthetic things I am of a dynamic mindset.  I recently learned to skateboard, something I was never able to do when I was younger.  With most things, I was someone with a fixed mindset.  I preferred sticking to things that I was good at, because I was good at them.  While I appreciated a challenge, I really only liked challenges I could quickly master.  DBC really stressed this flaw and myself during the first two weeks of phase 0.  I was venturing into new and rocky terrain, and things just weren't going as smoothly as I wanted.  Because I am aware of the fixed vs dynamic mindset, I understood part of the reason for my troubles.  I also have been attempting to become of a dynamic mindset.  This hasn't been exactly easy, but as someone with a dynamic mindset will tell you, it isn't supposed to always be easy.  Just this little loop of trying to think with a dynamic mindset has increased my ability to think with a dynamic mindset.  I don't always succeed, but what is important is that I keep on trying and work towards my goals, whatever they may be at the time.
