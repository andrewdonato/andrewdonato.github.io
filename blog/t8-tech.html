    	I have been learning about the object-oriented programming language ruby for a short while now and I keep hearing about ruby on rails.
    	Well it's time to finally learn what that means. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Rails or "Ruby on Rails" is framework created for the ruby language.  
    	A framework is a software library that adds to a languages library.
    	In ruby package libraries are called RubyGems.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Rails is a website building framework. It creates web applications on a server uses Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    	This is what makes rails a "back-end web application development platform" although it is also used for front-end.

    	Rails is built on the collaboration of many in the rails community and has an open source software library. 
    </p>
    <p>	
    	Rails is built for speed. It contains prebuilt structures for creating databases, web services and web pages. 
    	It does this using the MVC (Model-View-controller) pattern. 
    	A model is a map to a table in a database.
    	A view is what the file looks like in html.
    	A controller is a component of rails that is on the client side that answers requests from the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Ruby on Rails has been criticized for its scalability due to Twitter outages.
    	There are many examples of successful large scalability with sites such as Hulu, Scribd, and Github.
