      This week we covered Ruby classes.  What is a class in ruby (or other object oriented languages)?  
      A class in an object oriented language operates in the same manner that classifications do in the real or physical world.
      An object is a thing that belongs to a class.  A class is a way to talk about multiple objects that have similar characteristics or functions.
      Below I have created the class Container and will use this to explain how classes in an object oriented language translate into the physical realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <Ruby>
        class Container
          def initialize(max_size)
            @max_size = max_size
            @items_in_bag = Array.new()
          end
          
          def size
            @max_size
          end
          
          def add(items_array)
            items_array.each_with_index do |item, index|
              @items_in_bag << item
            end
            raise ArgumentError.new ("Bag cannot fit all items") if @items_in_bag.length > @max_size
          end
            
          def look_inside
            p @items_in_bag
          end
          
        end

        bag = Container.new(10)

        p "Maximum amount of items: " + bag.size.to_s
        bag.add([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        bag.look_inside

        bag.add([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
        bag.look_inside

        bag.add([11])
        bag.look_inside          
      </Ruby>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have created the class Container.  In ruby and other object oriented languages everything is an object, this includes classes. 
        While a container itself is an object that can holds things, other objects that have similar function and behavior can be classified as containers as well.
        In the above example, I have created a bag under the classification of container.  
        Similarly I could have created a jar, or a box, or even a persons hands if we were only talking about the ability to hold/contain things.
        All these things fall under the classification of container.
        This is because they all have the same function (holding stuff) and the same limitations (how much stuff they can hold).
        The bag, the jar, the box, the hands holding stuff, all are different instances of objects that can be classified as a container.

    </p>
     <p>
        In this example the bag, which is a container, has two different methods that can be called on it.  
        These methods are adding items, and seeing what items are inside the container.
        Another method I should have created would have been to remove items, but I will save that for another time.
        Just like in real world, you can perform one of these actions(methods) on the item.
        You can look inside the bag (bag.look_inside), add things to the bag (bag.add(thing)) or remove things from the bag (bag.remove(thing)).
        Although not yet on that last part, but thats the general idea.
