    <p>
    	Array and Hashes are two different yet similar types of objects in an object oriented language such as Ruby.  
    	They are similar in that they both can contain multiple elements.  What differs is how they are organized and how the elements are called.
    </p>
    <p>
        An array is organized numerically.  This is done by way of index number.  An array's index begins with 0.
    </p>
    <p>
    	food = ["apple", "cheeseburger", "pizza", "pie", "tomato"]
    </p>
    <p> 
    	In the example above, the 1st element "apple" can be called by using "food[0]", because the index begins with 0.  Likewise the last element "tomato" can be called by using "food[4]".  An additional method for calling tomato would be "food[-1]".  Because indices start with 0, Ruby knows to call the last letter.  So in that regard, an alternate method for calling "apple" would be to  tell ruby to call "food[-5]."
    </p>
    <p>
    	Hashes are not organized in the same way as arrays.  The elements are not numbered by index.  
    	Instead the elements of a hash are organized into key/value pairs.
    	The way to call up a value in a hash is to use its key.
    </p>
    <p>
    	food = { "fruit" => "apple", "lunch" => "cheeseburger", "dinner" => "pizza", "counts as a vegetable" => "tomato"}
    </p>
    <p>
    	In this example, the elements of "food" are not linked to a specific index number (well maybe a little, more on that later) but are linked to the key given to them.  So to call up "apple" with this example, the command would be 'food["fruit"]', this would give you "apple".
    	As far as the index number goes, "food[0]" would not give you "apple".
    	If you wanted to use index numbers to call "apple", you would have to take into consideration both the key and the value.
    	"food[0][1]" would call apple, because it is in the first [0] element, and is the second [1] part of that element.
    </p>
    <p>
    	A reason you would use an array is to organize a list or similar grouping.
    	places_to_visit = ["Egypt, "Greece", "Spain", "Japan", "Antarctica"]

    	A hash would be used if multiple dissimilar information was needed to be stored.
    	For example someones personal information:
    	profile_information = { "name" => "Ragnar", "occupation" => "Viking", "like" => "pillaging", "dislike" => "sailing east" }
    </p>
