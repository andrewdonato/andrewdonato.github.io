Shereef's fireside chat about kitchens vs. restaurants was unexpectedly uplifting. I have been struggling with this first week and was honestly feeling quite miserable about it.  And of course I was ruminating on it, which only makes the situation worse.
So listening to him I realized that I had been thinking about things with that consumer mindset, instead of the creator mindset that I was hoping to achieve.  I kept running into wall after wall and I was not only letting it get to me, but I was reacting to it in the right way either.

So yeah, I've been struggling, but I've also been handling it wrong.  Instead of getting frustrated and wasting hours picking through forums and reinstalling/reconfiguring/re-agitating myself to figure out why things weren't working the way they were supposed to, I should be reaching out for help and asking how can I make this work the way I want it to.
It's all about the nuance and how you look it at.  Devbootcamp isn't supposed to give me the answer. I need to take an active role and take it from Devbootcamp.  Hmmm, I didn't intend for that to sound as selfish as it might sound.
