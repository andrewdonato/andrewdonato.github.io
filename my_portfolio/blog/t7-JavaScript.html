      Javascript(JS) and Ruby are both object oriented languages (Javascript also uses prototypes) as opposed to a language like html which is called a markup language. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      Object oriented languages treat everything as an object with values that can be modified.  This includes things like functions or constants.  Both languages have similar objects such as strings( "Hat" ), arrays( arr = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ), booleans( true && true ), numbers( 5 ), and comparisons( < ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because both JS and Ruby are object oriented they behave in very similar ways.
      They do have certain syntax differences.  Ruby uses "end" after a loop beginning and has part of the loop ( i += 1 ) within the argument.  JS would use (loop){argument}; to create the loop then encompass what is being looped.  
    </p>
    <p>
      loop in ruby
      <ruby>
        i = 0
        while i < 5
          p "This is iteration #{i}"
          i += 1
        end
      </ruby>      
    </p>
    <p>
      Loop in javascript
      <javascript>
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          console.log( "This is iteration " + i ) 
        };
      </javascript>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both loops perform the same function (except the Ruby one might add quotes around the string) and while the loops are written differently, they still contain many of the same statements; i = 0, i < 5, i += 1 (i++ in the JS example, but I could have used "i += 1").
      Other similarities between the languages are the terms break (which escapes the current loop) and return (which tells the computer to hold the answer from the loop).  With return however, JS requires you to use it if you want to hold the answer where Ruby automatically returns the last thing that happened in a method.
