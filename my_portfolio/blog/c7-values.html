  <h1>Affirmation and values</h1>

      These values all have played parts in my life (not necessarily at the same time) for when I have been the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied.
      The numbers next to them (from 1 to 5) represent how much I try to live up to that particular value.  Just to clarify, these are all values I adhere to a certain degree.  A value with a one is still more than a value not listed.

      Adventure is a value that is and always has been high on my list.  Adventure encompasses many of the above values.  Challenge, confidence, coolness under fire, creativity, enthusiasm, excitement, fame, freedom, independence, influence, movement, personal development, pleasure, self-reliance are all major parts of adventure, yet depending on the adventure, many other values will likely apply as well.  The part I like about adventure the most is the exploration (an above value that I added), finding and discovering new things feels dangerous and exciting.  Whether that new thing is a new programming method or an old relic from a long gone society (it's new to me) there is always a sense of wonder and accomplishment that goes along with it.  By seeing this new construct (whatever it may be), I have learned more about the world and expanded my own universe and influence.  Adventure teaches you about the world, and about yourself.  Even if there is nothing new to learn, it allows you to experience some of the greatness of mankind or the majesty of nature.

      Somebody recently asked me advice on the content for a website they are developing.  They wanted my help to decide which content they should post and how to reach more people.  The values related to this that I find important are recognition, reputation, influence, quality, and pleasure. They were trying to increase their recognition, gain a positive reputation and increase their influence by providing a quality product to the pleasure of the target audience.

      When I think about my values, I feel happy and empowered.  I think that refocusing on my values and prompting myself to feel this positive affirmation would help stem stereotype threat, but only if I recognize that I am feeling it.  Self-knowledge is very important in this regard, because only if I notice that I am threatened can I mitigate the effects with this positive affirmation.  One exercise I like to use when I am feeling down is to refocus on something else.  Self-knowledge is very important in this aspect as well because there are so many different options of things to refocus on.  Ideally I would refocus on something that is productive and challenging yet attainable.  The goal is to give myself a small victory to rebound off of before refocusing on the intial task.  It is also important to celebrate the small victory, even in a small way like simply acknowledging and congratulating myself on doing so.  This helps maintain the positive momentum.
