      Asking questions is a very important skill in life and at DBC.
      There are many resources out there with information pertaining to what one might want to know.
      Much of this information is available because others have asked the question beforehand.
      At times the only way to find out something is to ask the question yourself.      
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the aspects that make a question good or bad?
      Here is a question I asked my cohort when I first joined DBC.
        
      <h6>

        Hey guys, I've been having a heck of a time trying to install everything and get my computer ready for DBC.  I am currently running against a wall installing chocolatey.

        I've tried both commands posted on (even though it says not to)
        https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1/blob/master/week-1/4-computer-setup/windows-instructions.md
        The 1st one gave me an "unexpected token" error.
        The 2nd one was able to extract chocolatey but then when installing, immediately gave me an error saying that it "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system."  It also said that "FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess"

        Powershell is not recognizing the commands "cinst" or "gem" so I am unable to use it to install everything that follows.

        I've changed my execution policy to AllSigned
        https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847748.aspx
        but that didn't seem to have any effect.  Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm not sure what else to try.

      Was this be a good or bad question?
      Lets take a look at it using guidelines provided by a stackoverflow article on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">how to ask a good question?</a> and the blog post<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">Writing the Perfect Question</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing I noticed was that I do not have a title. 
      While this is partly due to the type of post this was, my first introductory sentence does not have the characteristics of a good title.
      I wasn't specific enough.  I said that my problem was installing chocolatey but I did not give the context in which I was trying to install it.
      The next thing I noticed was that I do not actually ask any specific questions.
      I explained my problem but I didn't actually ask anything until the blanket statement at the end which showed that I was confused.  
      One thing I did well was fully describing the errors I was getting.
      Another good habit was posting links to refer to the specific content that was I was discussing at the time.           
    </p>
    <p>
      My post may not have had all the hallmarks of a good question, but it had enough details that it was understood and answered.
      I had the benefit of posting to DBC and people who were facing many of the same challenges that I was.
      If my post had a different audience, I do not know that it would have been answered as easily
      Writing good questions is an important skill as questions are often the last recourse after being unable to find pre-existing research.
