        Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
        What was the source of the conflict?
        What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
        What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
        If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
        What did you learn from this experience?

    <p>
        A friend of mine returned home with his wife to visit family and friends.
        Beforehand he had me and another friend set aside time to schedule a visit with him and her.
        After scheduling him in and setting up a day to get dinner, 
        he canceled on us and said he would no longer be able to meet up this trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was conflicted because it seemed as if my friend did not value my time or my friendship as much as I valued his.
        I felt like I was not important enough to see.
        I felt slightly angry, frustrated, sad, annoyed, and self contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to resolve the conflict, my other friend and I called my visiting friend out(more playful banter than cruel accusations) for making us set a time only in order to ditch us.
        I'm not sure what else I could have done differently.
    </p>
    <p>
        From this experience I learned that I do not like when I feel my value is undermined or considered less important than someone elses.
        I also learned that I use blunt humor in order to raise my net value and to resolve conflicts.
        I was open to let my friend know of my dissatisfaction but was at the same time wanting to forgive and move on.
