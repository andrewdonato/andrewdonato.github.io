What is Version control and why is it important?  Version control is a save point.  It allows a creator to continue working on a project while continually saving rough drafts or different iterations of the creators work.  If a mistake is made, the creator can go back and pull up an earlier version.  If the creator changes his or her mind, or wants to attempt muliple possibilities, version control will allow the creator to do so and to return to any other point.

Git is the program that helps you keep track of those changes.  It does so by keeping track of the differences so the user does not have to store all the memory of each of the different interations of the users projects.  Git is local. Github is remote.
<p>
GitHub is where users can store their projects remotely.  This is useful because it allows creators to share and collaborate, all the while keeping track of all the different interations.  It also allows users to access it from anywhere with an available network.
