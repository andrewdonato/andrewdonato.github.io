      CSS is a way of adding style to HTML.  While styling can be added directly into HTML, it is good practice to use CSS because it allows you to apply one CSS stylesheet to multiple HTML pages.  It also makes changing and style much easier to do, because you can just adjust the 1 CSS page and not have to manually do each HTML component directly.

      CSS allows you to create boxes with which to display your content.  Boxes consist of elements such as padding, border, and margins around the content inside of them.  These boxes are actually quite similar to physical real world boxes in how they operate.

      Thinking in terms of physical world boxes, with CSS the box itself (the cardboard part) is the border.  The border makes up the CSS box and is often given visible dimensions.  With the border is what is being boxed up, the content.  The content acts as the physical object that you would be trying to protect, put away, or transport in the cardboard analogue.  To protect the content from getting jostled around the box, as well as to keep the box balanced, there is something called a padding.  The padding is wrapped around the content, within the confines of the box.  
      The last part is the Margin.  The margin is the space around the box.  This space is what prevents other boxes or objects from getting to close to the box and its content.  The margin is like the padding except on the outside rather than the inside.
