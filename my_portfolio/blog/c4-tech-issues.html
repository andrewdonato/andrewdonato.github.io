      One of the problems facing the tech industry is a lack of diversity. According to information gathered by CNN Money and Informations Is Beautiful, across the board of the many different tech companies are jobs held by mostly White males, followed by Asian males.  
      Women are rare in the tech industry, especially with job positions such as Officers, Managers, Mid-level Managers, Mid-level officers, and the professional and technical postions.  The highest percentage of women in the tech industry can be seen in administrative positions and to a lesser extent sales.  
      Even rarer than women in the tech industry are non-Asian minorties such as Latino or Black.  While the White population is the majority population in the united states, the Black and Latino population have tech industry representatives falling well below their percentage in the American population. Asians on the other hand have a much higher percentage in the tech industry than compared to their percentage in the American population.

      This asymmetry in the tech industry causes problems for many reasons.  Of course there is the matter of civil rights and equal opportunity.  However on top of that this disrepresentation is not doing the tech industry any favors with meeting the needs of their audience.  The United States is considered a cultural melting pot, but with not all cultures having proper representation in the tech industry many consumers have been alienated.
      Back in 2010 Microsoft discovered this with their Kinect which had difficulty with the facial recognition of dark skinned users.  The Kinect was marketed as inclusive fun for everyone, yet this obviously hurt Microsofts campaign as not all users were able to use the full functionality of the Kinect.  Additionally Microsoft had to face the fallback of being labeled or questioned as racist.  Microsoft was not alone in this, the year before HP faced similar claims with their MediaSmart webcam technology.  Both Microsoft and HP troubles were due to lighting contast issues, but it begs the question that if these companies had a better representation of the population would these issues have been as likely to occur.  It might have meant a wider range of testing on these technologies and if the issue still occurred, it would have given them better footing against claims of racism.

      Diversity is a very important construct.  Farmers diversify their crops because it is good for the soil and doesn't limit them to a single seasonal item.  Investors diversify their portfolios in order to make gains with some investments while other investments are stagnant or falling.  A diverse gene pool is better protected against disease than a non-diverse one.  Why should industry be any different? Employing a diverse group will allow a company to reach a diverse audience.
